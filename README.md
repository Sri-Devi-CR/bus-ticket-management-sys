# bus-ticket-management-sys
This repository contains the code files that enable users to book a bus ticket or an entire bus. This project was developed during my class XII.

This project is a basic bus ticket management system that is built using Tkinter, mysql.connector and other Python libraries. 

It enables a user to book a ticket to travel between cities. This project also allows a user to book an entire bus in case of a road/school trip.
